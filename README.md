ðŸ‘‹ Hello Ello
I'm really excited about potentially joining the team,

## Challenge

As part of our goal to have Ello impact as many children as we can, we offer an Ello web viewer product. [https://books.ello.com](https://books.ello.com/)

We give this to certain schools for free to allow teachers to share our books with children.
You are building part of the teacher-facing UI for this product,
namely the book assignment view, where teachers can assign books to students.

The view has the following features:-

- [x] A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.
- [x] A list of search results that displays the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the students reading list.
- [x] A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added.
- [x] A button to remove a book from the reading list.

To run the frontend, switch into the `src/frontend` folder and run

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the following command to start the server

```bash
npm start
```
